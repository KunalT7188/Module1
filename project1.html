        <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
        <p>Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 <br> <br>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup language. It is a standard text formatting language used for developing web pages released in 1993. HTML is a language that is interpreted by the browser and it tells the browser what to display and how to display.<br>
            <br>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It’s a style sheet language that determines how the elements/contents in the page are looked/shown. CSS is used to develop a consistent look and feel for all the pages.</p>

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Developed by James Gosling in 1991<br> <br>
            The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it portable, simple and secure programming language. Apart from this, there are also some excellent features which play an important role in the popularity of this language. The features of Java are also known as Java buzzwords.
            <ul>
                <li> Simple</li>
                <li> Object-Oriented</li>
                <li> Platform independent</li>
                <li> Secured and Robust</li>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995<br> <br>
            It was initially created to develop dynamic web pages. Every JS program is called a script, which can be attached to any web page’s HTML. These scripts run automatically when the page loads.
A language which was initially used to create dynamic web pages, can now be executed on the server and practically on any device consisting of the JavaScript Engine.
